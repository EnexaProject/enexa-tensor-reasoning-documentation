    \section{Unit Clause Propagation (UCP)}

    Unit clauses are assignments to single variables.
    They are propagated between clusters of formulas


    \subsection{Forward Chaining for Horn-SAT}

    Forward chaining is a linear time and complete satisfiability checker on Horn Logic (a subset of Propositional Logic where each clause has at most one positive literal).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Messages passed are the one-hot encodings of assignment to single variables (unit clauses).
        \item Clusters are the Horn clauses, which receive messages for their negative literals.
        A Cluster sends a nontrivial message to a variable, if the variable is the only unassigned literal in the clause and the clause has not been satisfied yet.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{UCP for 2-SAT}

    2-SAT is in P and can be solved by the message passing algorithm Unit Clause Propagation (UCP).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Messages passed are the one-hot encodings of assignment to single variables (unit clauses).
        \item Any clause that receives a message has only a single literal left and either gets directly trivial (if the message coincides with the literal) or assigns the remaining variable and passes further.
    \end{itemize}


    \subsection{DPLL for generic SAT}

    DPLL combines backtracking search with unit clause propagation (UCP).
    A form of message passing is applied to reduce the clauses given the current partial assignment:
    When guessed an assignment to a variable, the variable is removed from all clauses, either making the clause trivial (coinciding assignment) or smaller.
    If only one literal remains in a clause, the variable would be assigned accordingly (unit propagation).
    This can be directly done in the intermediate message passing scheme, or understood as the next backtracking step ("Find-Unit-Clause" in Figure 7.17 in \cite{russell_artificial_2021}).

    \section{WalkSAT}

    WalkSAT is a stochastic local search algorithm for SAT.
    It starts with a random assignment and iteratively flips variables to reduce the number of unsatisfied clauses.
    This can be understood as a (modified) Gibbs sampling algorithm, where the number of unsatisfied clauses is the energy function to be minimized.
    The modifications are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Selection of variable to be resampled: Typically chosen by looking at unsatisfied clauses and picking a variable that minimizes the number of newly unsatisfied clauses (whereas in Gibbs sampling one follows a fixed variable order).
        \item Marginal probability: Typically fixed by a mixing parameter, whereas in Gibbs sampling would be sensitive to the energy differences.
    \end{itemize}
