\chapter{Introduction into Part III}

We frequently worked in \parref{par:one} and \parref{par:two} with tensors, which have non-negative coordinates and occasionally are boolean (see \defref{def:booleanTensor}) or directed (see \defref{def:directedTensor}).
While boolean tensors have appeared as semantical representation of formulas, directed tensors have appeared mostly as conditional distributions.
In this chapter we provide further insights into the situation, where tensors satisfy both.
For a schematic depiction of this see \figref{fig:dbTensorSketch}.
