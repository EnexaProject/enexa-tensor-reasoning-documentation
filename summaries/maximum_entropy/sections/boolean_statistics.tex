\section{Characterization for boolean statistics}

\red{We here study the face CP ranks in case of boolean statistics.
We further show that any elementary \ComputationActivationNetwork{} to boolean statistics is a maximum entropy distribution.}

For boolean statistics $\hlnstat:\facstates\rightarrow\bigtimes_{\selindexin}[2]$ the mean polytope is a subset of the cube $[0,1]^\seldim$.
In this case, any boolean vector in $\meansetof{\hlnstat,\basemeasure}$ is a vertex.
It follows, that any distribution reproducing a mean parameter $\meanparamwith$ on the effective interior of $\meansetof{\hlnstat,\basemeasure}$ is positive with respect to $\basemeasure$.

We apply the exponential distribution characterization of the maximum entropy distribution and get that the maximum entropy distribution is in $\elrealizabledistsof{\sstat}$, if and only if the face measure is in $\elrealizabledistsof{\sstat}$.
This is exactly the case, when the face is an intersection of the mean polytope with a face of the cupe $[0,1]^\seldim$.

\subsection{Set of maximum entropy distributions}

\begin{theorem}
    Any distribution in $\elrealizabledistsof{\hlnstat}$ is a maximum entropy distribution.
    Any maximum entropy distribution is realized by $\elrealizabledistsof{\hlnstat}$ if and only if the mean parameter is on an effective interior of a cube-like face.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    First claim by decomposing any elementary tensor into exponential and hard activation core.
    Second claim by characterization of elementary faces by cube-likeness.
\end{proof}

The mean parameters, which can be realized by a distribution in $\elrealizabledistsof{\hlnstat}$ are those, which are on the effective interior of the intersection of the mean polytope with a face of the cube.
