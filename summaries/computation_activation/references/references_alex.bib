	shorttitle = {Era of Big Data Processing},
	abstract = {Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts of multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality. Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks ({TNs}) and tensor decompositions ({TDs}) which represent tensors by sets of factor (component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect relationships. We will discuss some fundamental {TN} models, their mathematical and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale {TDs} and {TNs}, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection, feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series analysis and multiway component analysis.

	abstract = {A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems ({MANDy}) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.},

In this paper, we argue that the naive approach to this problem is doomed to failure because, unlike matrices, tensors of order 3 or higher can fail to have best rank-r approximations. The phenomenon is much more widespread than one might suspect: examples of this failure can be constructed over a wide range of dimensions, orders and ranks, regardless of the choice of norm (or even Br`egman divergence). Moreover, we show that in many instances these counterexamples have positive volume: they cannot be regarded as isolated phenomena. In one extreme case, we exhibit a tensor space in which no rank-3 tensor has an optimal rank-2 approximation. The notable exceptions to this misbehavior are rank-1 tensors and order-2 tensors (i.e. matrices).},

This hierarchical {SVD} has properties like the matrix {SVD} (and collapses to the {SVD} in d = 2), and we prove these. In particular, one can find low rank (almost) best approximations in a hierarchical format (H-Tucker) which requires only O((d - 1)k3 + dnk) parameters, where d is the order of the tensor, n the size of the modes, and k the (hierarchical) rank. The H-Tucker format is a specialization of the Tucker format and it contains as a special case all (canonical) rank k tensors. Based on this new concept of a hierarchical {SVD} we present algorithms for hierarchical tensor calculations allowing for a rigorous error analysis. The complexity of the truncation (finding lower rank approximations to hierarchical rank k tensors) is in O((d-1)k4+dnk2) and the attainable accuracy is just 2-3 digits less than machine precision.},

	abstract = {Recently, the format of {TT} tensors (Hackbusch and Kühn in J Fourier Anal Appl 15:706–722, 2009; Oseledets in {SIAM} J Sci Comput 2009, submitted; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in {SIAM} J Sci Comput 31:5, 2009; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in Linear Algebra Appl 2009, submitted) has turned out to be a promising new format for the approximation of solutions of high dimensional problems. In this paper, we prove some new results for the {TT} representation of a tensor U ∈ Rn1×···×nd and for the manifold of tensors of {TT}-rank r . As a ﬁrst result, we prove that the {TT} (or compression) ranks ri of a tensor U are unique and equal to the respective separation ranks of U if the components of the {TT} decomposition are required to fulﬁl a certain maximal rank condition. We then show that the set T of {TT} tensors of ﬁxed rank r locally forms an embedded manifold in Rn1×···×nd , therefore preserving the essential theoretical properties of the Tucker format, but often showing an improved scaling behaviour. Extending a similar approach for matrices (Conte and Lubich in M2AN 44:759, 2010), we introduce certain gauge conditions to obtain a unique representation of the tangent space {TU} T of T and deduce a local parametrization of the {TT} manifold. The parametrisation of {TU} T is often crucial for an algorithmic treatment of high-dimensional time-dependent {PDEs} and minimisation problems (Lubich in From quantum to classical molecular dynamics: reduced methods and numerical analysis, 2008). We conclude with remarks on those applications and present some numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying framework for capturing complex dependencies among random variables, and building large-scale multivariate statistical models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances-including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions-are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, Graphical Models, Exponential Families and Variational Inference develops general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. It describes how a wide variety of algorithms- among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, and max-product-can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

	abstract = {This thesis contributes to the uniform concentration approach towards guaranteeing the generalization of learned models. We show probabilistic bounds on various uniform concentration events and demonstrate their utility in recovery guarantees. The thesis is organized in three parts. In the first part, we develop a unified theoretical framework for the concentration of random variables and the uniform concentration of stochastic processes. We introduce functionals of stochastic processes and apply them in bounds on the supremum. Then we develop methods to transfer uniform concentration events into success guarantees for empirical risk minimization problems. The second part of this thesis investigates classes of structured random distributions. More precisely, we derive bounds on the uniform concentration of contracted random tensors, which are decomposable into tensor network formats. In particular, we show exact moment bounds on contracted Gaussian tensor networks, which are tensor networks consistent of independent standard Gaussian random cores. By applying comparison theorems for Gaussian variables, the upper moment bounds are extended to more generic Orlicz tensor networks, which are characterized by weaker assumptions made on the random cores. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the concentration of Haar tensor networks, which random cores follow the Haar distribution of Stiefel manifolds. For all examples we continue to provide probabilistic bounds on uniform concentration events, which imply recovery guarantees for tensor regression problems. We further apply our findings in deriving success guarantees for efficient algorithms solving tensor regression problems. In the third part, we transfer our findings to bounds on the uniform concentration of neural networks following two approaches. First, we derive concentration bounds for shallow {ReLU} networks with respect to standard Gaussian distributions, where we introduce parameter embeddings that capture the concentration structure. Second, we bound the Rademacher complexity of deep neural networks, which are activated by a contraction, by Rademacher complexities of linear functions. This enables the proof of recovery guarantees for neural networks, which are trained on structured data.},

Inference in {MLNs} is performed by {MCMC} over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efﬁciently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

Inductive Logic Programming ({ILP}) can be used to mine logical rules from the {KB}. These rules can help deduce and add missing knowledge to the {KB}. While {ILP} is a mature ﬁeld, mining logical rules from {KBs} is diﬀerent in two aspects: First, current rule mining systems are easily overwhelmed by the amount of data (state-of-the art systems cannot even run on today’s {KBs}). Second, {ILP} usually requires counterexamples. {KBs}, however, implement the open world assumption ({OWA}), meaning that absent data cannot be used as counterexamples. In this paper, we develop a rule mining model that is explicitly tailored to support the {OWA} scenario. It is inspired by association rule mining and introduces a novel measure for conﬁdence. Our extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and coverage. Furthermore, our system, {AMIE}, mines rules orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Most existing approaches for class expression learning in description logics are search algorithms. As the search space of these approaches is infinite, they often fail to scale to large learning problems. Our main intuition is that class expression learning can be regarded as a translation problem. Based thereupon, we propose a new family of class expression learning approaches which we dub neural class expression synthesis. Instances of this new family circumvent the high search costs entailed by current algorithms by translating training examples into class expressions in a fashion akin to machine translation solutions. Consequently, they are not subject to the runtime limitations of search-based approaches post training. We study three instances of this novel family of approaches to synthesize class expressions from sets of positive and negative examples. An evaluation of our approach on four benchmark datasets suggests that it can effectively synthesize high-quality class expressions with respect to the input examples in approximately one second on average. Moreover, a comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches suggests that we achieve better F-measures on large datasets. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our implementation as well as pretrained models in our public {GitHub} repository at https://github.com/fosterreproducibleresearch/{NCES}.},

Given a linear Datalog program {DB} written using N constants and binary predicates, we first translate if-and-only-if completions of clauses in {DB} into a set E q ({DB}) of matrix equations with a non-linear operation, where relations in M {DB}, the least Herbrand model of {DB}, are encoded as adjacency matrices. We then translate E q ({DB}) into another, but purely linear matrix equations Ẽ q ({DB}). It is proved that the least solution of Ẽ q ({DB}) in the sense of matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of E q ({DB}) and the latter gives M {DB} as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence, computing the least solution of Ẽ q ({DB}) is equivalent to computing M {DB} specified by {DB}. For a class of tail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach achieves O(N 3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a clause since only matrix operations costing O(N 3) or less are used. We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear Datalog programs. The first experiment computes transitive closure of artificial data and real network data taken from the Koblenz Network Collection. The second one compared the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art symbolic systems including two Prolog systems and two {ASP} systems, in terms of computation time for a transitive closure program and the same generation program. In the experiment, it is observed that our linear algebraic approach runs 101 {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 104 times faster than the symbolic systems when data is not sparse. Our approach is inspired by the emergence of big knowledge graphs and expected to contribute to the realization of rich and scalable logical inference for knowledge graphs.},

Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2\% vs. 54.7\% by {TransE} on Freebase).

	abstract = {The availability of structured data has increased significantly over the past decade and several approaches to learn from structured data have been proposed. These logic-based, inductive learning methods are often conceptually similar, which would allow a comparison among them even if they stem from different research communities. However, so far no efforts were made to define an environment for running learning tasks on a variety of tools, covering multiple knowledge representation languages. With {SML}-Bench, we propose a benchmarking framework to run inductive learning tools from the {ILP} and semantic web communities on a selection of learning problems. In this paper, we present the foundations of {SML}-Bench, discuss the systematic selection of benchmarking datasets and learning problems, and showcase an actual benchmark run on the currently supported tools.},

This survey identifies seven shared dimensions between these two subfields of {AI}. These dimensions can be used to characterize different {NeSy} and {StarAI} systems. They are concerned with (1) the approach to logical inference, whether model or proof-based; (2) the syntax of the used logical theories; (3) the logical semantics of the systems and their extensions to facilitate learning; (4) the scope of learning, encompassing either parameter or structure learning; (5) the presence of symbolic and subsymbolic representations; (6) the degree to which systems capture the original logic, probabilistic, and neural paradigms; and (7) the classes of learning tasks the systems are applied to. By positioning various {NeSy} and {StarAI} systems along these dimensions and pointing out similarities and differences between them, this survey contributes fundamental concepts for understanding the integration of learning and reasoning.},

An extended version of propositional calculus is developed and is demonstrated to be useful for nonmonotonic reasoning, dealing with conflicting beliefs and for coping with inconsistency generated by unreliable knowledge sources. Formulas of the extended calculus are proved to be equivalent in a very strong sense to symmetric networks (like Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines), and efficient algorithms are given for translating back and forth between the two forms of knowledge representation. A fast learning procedure is presented that allows symmetric networks to learn representations of unknown logic formulas by looking at examples. A connectionist inference engine is then sketched whose knowledge is either compiled from a symbolic representation or learned inductively from training examples. Experiments with large scale randomly generated formulas suggest that the parallel local search that is executed by the networks is extremely fast on average. Finally, it is shown that the extended logic can be used as a high-level specification language for connectionist networks, into which several recent symbolic systems may be mapped. The paper demonstrates how a rigorous bridge can be constructed that ties together the (sometimes opposing) connectionist and symbolic approaches.},

The hallmark of our algorithm is the evaluation of the regular path queries found in conjunctive regular path queries using multi-way joins. This enables the exploitation of regular path queries in the planning steps of the proposed algorithm, which is crucial for the algorithm’s efficiency, as shown by the results of our detailed evaluation using the Wikidata-based benchmark {WDBench}. The results of this evaluation also show that our approach achieves a value of query mixes per hour that is 4.3 higher than the state of the art and that it outperforms all of the competing graph storage solutions in almost 70\% of the benchmark’s queries.},

The algorithm performs a beam or shortest-first search of the space of clauses, guided by a weighted pseudo-likelihood measure. This requires computing the optimal weights for each candidate structure, but we show how this can be done efficiently. The algorithm can be used to learn an {MLN} from scratch, or to refine an existing knowledge base. We have applied it in two real-world domains, and found that it outperforms using off-the-shelf {ILP} systems to learn the {MLN} structure, as well as pure {ILP}, purely probabilistic and purely knowledge-based approaches.},

	abstract = {A robot that can be simply told in natural language what to do – this has been one of the ultimate long-standing goals in both Artificial Intelligence and Robotics research. In near-future applications, robotic assistants and companions will have to understand and perform commands such as set the table for dinner”, make pancakes for breakfast”, or cut the pizza into 8 pieces.” Although such instructions are only vaguely formulated, complex sequences of sophisticated and accurate manipulation activities need to be carried out in order to accomplish the respective tasks. The acquisition of knowledge about how to perform these activities from huge collections of natural-language instructions from the Internet has garnered a lot of attention within the last decade. However, natural language is typically massively unspecific, incomplete, ambiguous and vague and thus requires powerful means for interpretation. This work presents {PRAC} – Probabilistic Action Cores – an interpreter for natural-language instructions which is able to resolve vagueness and ambiguity in natural language and infer missing information pieces that are required to render an instruction executable by a robot. To this end, {PRAC} formulates the problem of instruction interpretation as a reasoning problem in first-order probabilistic knowledge bases. In particular, the system uses Markov logic networks as a carrier formalism for encoding uncertain knowledge. A novel framework for reasoning about unmodeled symbolic concepts is introduced, which incorporates ontological knowledge from taxonomies and exploits semantically similar relational structures in a domain of discourse. The resulting reasoning framework thus enables more compact representations of knowledge and exhibits strong generalization performance when being learnt from very sparse data. Furthermore, a novel approach for completing directives is presented, which applies semantic analogical reasoning to transfer knowledge collected from thousands of natural-language instruction sheets to new situations. In addition, a cohesive processing pipeline is described that transforms vague and incomplete task formulations into sequences of formally specified robot plans. The system is connected to a plan executive that is able to execute the computed plans in a simulator. Experiments conducted in a publicly accessible, browser-based web interface showcase that {PRAC} is capable of closing the loop from natural-language instructions to their execution by a robot.},

Previous research in knowledge graph embeddings has focused exclusively on Clifford algebras of a specific type, which do not include nilpotent base vectors—elements that square to zero. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two, leading to a more general form of Clifford algebras named degenerate Clifford algebras. This generalization to degenerate Clifford algebras does allow for covering dual numbers and as such include translations and rotations models under the same generalization paradigm for the first time. We develop two models to determine the parameters that define the algebra: one using a greedy search and another predicting the parameters based on neural network embeddings of the input knowledge graph. Our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets demonstrates that this incorporation of nilpotent vectors enhances the quality of embeddings. Additionally, our method outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches in terms of generalization, particularly regarding the mean reciprocal rank achieved on validation data. Finally, we show that even a simple greedy search can effectively discover optimal or near-optimal parameters for the algebra.},

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues.

	abstract = {A general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions.Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

Knowledge graphs are founded on the principle of applying a graph-based abstraction to data, and are now broadly deployed in scenarios that require integrating and extracting value from multiple, diverse sources of data at large scale. The book defines knowledge graphs and provides a high-level overview of how they are used. It presents and contrasts popular graph models that are commonly used to represent data as graphs, and the languages by which they can be queried before describing how the resulting data graph can be enhanced with notions of schema, identity, and context. The book discusses how ontologies and rules can be used to encode knowledge as well as how inductive techniques—based on statistics, graph analytics, machine learning, etc.—can be used to encode and extract knowledge. It covers techniques for the creation, enrichment, assessment, and refinement of knowledge graphs and surveys recent open and enterprise knowledge graphs and the industries or applications within which they have been most widely adopted. The book closes by discussing the current limitations and future directions along which knowledge graphs are likely to evolve. This book is aimed at students, researchers, and practitioners who wish to learn more about knowledge graphs and how they facilitate extracting value from diverse data at large scale. To make the book accessible for newcomers, running examples and graphical notation are used throughout.

	abstract = {Parameter estimation in Markov random fields ({MRFs}) is a difficult task, in which inference over the network is run in the inner loop of a gradient descent procedure. Replacing exact inference with approximate methods such as loopy belief propagation ({LBP}) can suffer from poor convergence. In this paper, we provide a different approach for combining {MRF} learning and Bethe approximation. We consider the dual of maximum likelihood Markov network learning — maximizing entropy with moment matching constraints — and then approximate both the objective and the constraints in the resulting optimization problem. Unlike previous work along these lines (Teh \&amp; Welling, 2003), our formulation allows parameter sharing between features in a general log-linear model, parameter regularization and conditional training. We show that piecewise training (Sutton \&amp; {McCallum}, 2005) is a very restricted special case of this formulation. We study two optimization strategies: one based on a single convex approximation and one that uses repeated convex approximations.

The reconstruction procedure is then based on one of the associated dual frames, which—in the case of a Parseval frame—can be chosen to be the frame itself. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the basics of finite frame theory upon which the subsequent chapters are based. After recalling some background information on Hilbert space theory and operator theory, we introduce the notion of a frame along with some crucial properties and construction procedures. Then we discuss algorithmic aspects such as basic reconstruction algorithms and present brief introductions to diverse applications and extensions of frames. The subsequent chapters of this book will then extend key topics in many intriguing directions.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other {AI} approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty-and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition-in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in {AI}, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in {AI}, operations research, or applied probability.},

A detailed analysis is given of "elementary" cellular automata consisting of a sequence of sites with values 0 or 1 on a line, with each site evolving deterministically in discrete time steps according to definite rules involving the values of its nearest neighbors. With simple initial configurations, the cellular automata either tend to homogeneous states, or generate self-similar patterns with fractal dimensions ≃ 1.59 or ≃ 1.69. With "random" initial configurations, the irreversible character of the cellular automaton evolution leads to several self-organization phenomena. Statistical properties of the structures generated are found to lie in two universality classes, independent of the details of the initial state or the cellular automaton rules. More complicated cellular automata are briefly considered, and connections with dynamical systems theory and the formal theory of computation are discussed.},

Instead of trying to understand or build brains from the bottom up, its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, putting the focus on what an agent needs to know in order to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed.

Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail.

	shorttitle = {0/1-Polytopes},
	abstract = {0/1-Polytopen kann man in vielen Gebieten der diskreten Mathematik begegnen. Das bekannteste ist als "polyedrische Kombinatorik" bekannt. Auch wenn man die polyedrische Kombinatorik meist mit kombinatorischer Optimierung in Verbindung bringt, gibt es wichtige Zusammenhänge zu anderen Gebieten, zum Beispiel zum Zählen von kombinatorischen Strukturen. Trotz ihres breiten Anwendungsspektrums existiert keine umfassende Theorie über 0/1-Polytope. Es scheint so als seien 0/1-Polytope besonders komplizierte Objekte. Die Ergebnisse, welche in dieser Dissertation dargestellt werden, gruppieren sich um drei Hauptthemen: (1) obere Schranken für die minimale Anzahl von Seiten (Kanten und Facetten), (2) eine Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani über die Kantenexpansion und (3) zufällige 0/1-Polytope. Zufälligen 0/1-Polytope können aus zwei verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachtet werden. Zum einen kann man Zufall benutzen, um die Komplexität allgemeiner 0/1-Polytope zu durchbrechen. Zum anderen kann man untersuchen, welche Eigenschaften zufällige 0/1-Polytope mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit besitzen. Dies sind dann typische Eigenschaften von 0/1-Polytopen und können nützlich sein, um Eigenschaften spezieller 0/1-Polytope einzuordnen. Nach einer kurzen Einführung in die Grundlagen der Polytoptheorie und einen Überblick über den aktuellen Stand der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der 0/1-Polytope, werden Grundlagen aus der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie kurz eingeführt. Die Ergebnisse zu zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen (3) umfassen: (a) Schwellenwert Resultate mit exponentieller Konvergenz zu der Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass {\textbackslash}k{\textbackslash} zufällige Ecken eines zufälligen 0/1-Polytopes eine {\textbackslash}(k-1){\textbackslash}-dimensionale Seite bilden; (b) Es gibt 0/1-Polytope mit exponentiell kleiner Eckenexpansion; (c) für jedes {\textbackslash}k{\textbackslash} gibt es eine Konstante {\textbackslash}c\_k{\textbackslash}, so dass ein zufälliges 0/1-Polytop in {\textbackslash}[0,1]ˆd{\textbackslash} mit höchstens {\textbackslash}2ˆ\{cd\}{\textbackslash} Ecken sehr wahrscheinlich {\textbackslash}k{\textbackslash}-nachbarschaftlich ist. Ergebnis (b) zeigt, dass es für die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2) nicht genügt die Eckenexpansion zu untersuchen. Allerdings scheint es schwierig oder unmöglich zu sein, dieses Negativresultat auf die Kantenexpansion auszuweiten. Ergebnisse (a) und (c) zeigen typische Eigenschaften von zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass ein vollständiger Graph für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung nichts besonderes sind, da diese Polytope meistens nur sub-exponentiell viele Ecken haben. Bekannte Beispiele für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung sind Traveling Salesman Polytope” und Cut-Polytope”. Im letzten Kapitel stellen wir revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope vor. Diese speziellen Knap{\textbackslash}textbackslash-sack-Poly{\textbackslash}textbackslash-tope haben sehr wenige Facetten und Kanten. Wir benutzen diese Polytope, um zu zeigen, dass es in jeder Dimension {\textbackslash}d{\textbackslash} und sinnvoller Eckenzahl {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash} ein {\textbackslash}d{\textbackslash}-dimensionales 0/1-Polytope mit {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash} Ecken gibt, welches höchstens {\textbackslash}3d{\textbackslash} Facetten und Eckengrad höchstens {\textbackslash}d+8{\textbackslash} hat. Dies sind die ersten Resultate zu oberen Schranken an die minimale Anzahl der Seiten von 0/1-Polytopen (1). Trotz des dünnen Graphen erfüllen diese 0/1-Polytope die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2). Abschließend betrachten wir noch kurz "erweiterte revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope", welche eine weiterführende Richtung in der Untersuchung von Knapsack-Polytopen im Hinblick auf die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani sein können.},

	abstract = {We study extensions of compressive sensing and low rank matrix recovery to the recovery of tensors of low rank from incomplete linear information. While the reconstruction of low rank matrices via nuclear norm minimization is rather well-understand by now, almost no theory is available so far for the extension to higher order tensors due to various theoretical and computational difficulties arising for tensor decompositions. In fact, nuclear norm minimization for matrix recovery is a tractable convex relaxation approach, but the extension of the nuclear norm to tensors is in general {NP}-hard to compute. In this article, we introduce convex relaxations of the tensor nuclear norm which are computable in polynomial time via semidefinite programming. Our approach is based on theta bodies, a concept from real computational algebraic geometry which is similar to the one of the better known Lasserre relaxations. We introduce polynomial ideals which are generated by the second-order minors corresponding to different matricizations of the tensor (where the tensor entries are treated as variables) such that the nuclear norm ball is the convex hull of the algebraic variety of the ideal. The theta body of order k for such an ideal generates a new norm which we call the θk-norm. We show that in the matrix case, these norms reduce to the standard nuclear norm. For tensors of order three or higher however, we indeed obtain new norms. The sequence of the corresponding unit-θk-norm balls converges asymptotically to the unit tensor nuclear norm ball. By providing the Gröbner basis for the ideals, we explicitly give semidefinite programs for the computation of the θk-norm and for the minimization of the θk-norm under an affine constraint. Finally, numerical experiments for order-three tensor recovery via θ1-norm minimization suggest that our approach successfully reconstructs tensors of low rank from incomplete linear (random) measurements.},

A more general paradigm for attacking these tasks is the altenation of constraint manipulation and case analysis producing an {OR} problem graph which may be searched in any of the usual ways. Many authors, particularly Montanari and Waltz, have contributed to the development of these ideas; a secondary aim of this paper is to trace that history. The primary aim is to provide an accessible, unified framework, within which to present the algorithms including a new path consistency algorithm, to discuss their relationships and the may applications, both realized and potential of network consistency algorithms.},

	abstract = {This master's project concerns the use of multi-agent design principles in making efficient solvers for {NP}-complete problems. The design of computer programs as multi-agent systems presents a new and very promising software engineering paradigm, where systems are described as individual problem-solving agents pursuing high-level goals. Recently, researchers have started to apply the multi-agent paradigm to the construction of efficient solvers for {NP}-complete problems. This has resulted in very effective tools for routing problems, graph partitioning and {SAT}-solving. The objective of the present project is to make further studies into the application of multi-agent principles to solving {NP}-complete problems. More specifically, the project has the following two goals. First, it should result in a general discussion of the use of multi-agent approaches to solving {NP}-complete problems. This should include a discussion of strengths and weaknesses compared to other approaches of solving the same problems. Second, it should result in a concrete software tool for solving n2 £ n2 Sudoku puzzles, which is known to be an {NP}-complete problem. The tool should be benchmarked against other solvers for Sudoku.},

	abstract = {Current advances in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in general, and deep learning in particular have reached unprecedented impact not only across research communities, but also over popular media channels. However, concerns about interpretability and accountability of {AI} have been raised by influential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of {AI}, several works have identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and explainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable {AI} systems. The insights provided by neural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for interpretable and accountable {AI} systems.},

The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source. By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources. {KBANN} (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques. It maps problem-specific “domain theories”, represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation. {KBANN} is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology. Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by {KBANN} generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.},

Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-{IL}2P to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically {DNA} sequence analyses.

	abstract = {Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method ({TJM}), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function ({MCWF}) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle ({TDVP}) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling {MPS} to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of {XXX} Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade {CPU}. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.},

In this paper, we propose a new tensor rank reduction method based on coordinate transformations that can greatly increase the efficiency of high-dimensional tensor approximation algorithms. The idea is simple: given a multivariate function, determine a coordinate transformation so that the function in the new coordinate system has smaller tensor rank. We restrict our analysis to linear coordinate transformations, which gives rise to a new class of functions that we refer to as tensor ridge functions. Leveraging Riemannian gradient descent on matrix manifolds we develop an algorithm that determines a quasi-optimal linear coordinate transformation for tensor rank reduction. The results we present for rank reduction via linear coordinate transformations open the possibility for generalizations to larger classes of nonlinear transformations.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the approximation of high-dimensional functions in a statistical learning setting, by empirical risk minimization over model classes of functions in tree-based tensor format. These are particular classes of rank-structured functions that can be seen as deep neural networks with a sparse architecture related to the tree and multilinear activation functions. For learning in a given model class, we exploit the fact that tree-based tensor formats are multilinear models and recast the problem of risk minimization over a nonlinear set into a succession of learning problems with linear models. Suitable changes of representation yield numerically stable learning problems and allow to exploit sparsity. For high-dimensional problems or when only a small data set is available, the selection of a good model class is a critical issue. For a given tree, the selection of the tuple of tree-based ranks that minimize the risk is a combinatorial problem. Here, we propose a rank adaptation strategy which provides in practice a good convergence of the risk as a function of the model class complexity. Finding a good tree is also a combinatorial problem, which can be related to the choice of a particular sparse architecture for deep neural networks. Here, we propose a stochastic algorithm for minimizing the complexity of the representation of a given function over a class of trees with a given arity, allowing changes in the topology of the tree. This tree optimization algorithm is then included in a learning scheme that successively adapts the tree and the corresponding tree-based ranks. Contrary to classical learning algorithms for nonlinear model classes, the proposed algorithms are numerically stable, reliable, and require only a low level expertise of the user.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group ({DMRG}) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states ({MPS}). Although {MPS} is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the {MPS}. In this work, we extend the {DMRG} algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks ({TTNs}). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the {TTN} to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for {TTN} and show that {TTN} requires less memory than {MPS} for the simulations. For the {QAOA} circuits, a naive {TTN} construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the {DMRG} algorithm with {TTNs} provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.},

However, being a second-order method makes it infeasible to be used directly in problems with a huge number of parameters and data. This is evident from the community of deep learning sticking with the stochastic gradient descent method since the beginning.

An {MLN} has many regular, symmetric structures that can be exploited at both first-order level and in the generated Markov network. We analyze the graph structures that are produced by various lifting methods and investigate the extent to which quantum protocols can be used to speed up Gibbs sampling with state preparation and measurement schemes. We review different such approaches, discuss their advantages, theoretical limitations, and their appeal to implementations.

These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive ({AR}) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models ({dLLMs}) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their {AR} counterparts, it remains unclear if {dLLMs} can also leverage recent advances in {LLM} reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked {dLLMs} into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning ({SFT}) and {RL}. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained {dLLMs}: (a) we utilize a masked {SFT} technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based {RL} algorithm called diffu-{GRPO}, the first integration of policy gradient methods to masked {dLLMs}. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and planning benchmarks.

	abstract = {Tensor networks represent the state-of-the-art in computational methods across many disciplines, including the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems and quantum circuits. Several applications of current interest give rise to tensor networks with irregular geometries. Finding the best possible contraction path for such networks is a central problem, with an exponential effect on computation time and memory footprint. In this work, we implement new randomized protocols that find very high quality contraction paths for arbitrary and large tensor networks. We test our methods on a variety of benchmarks, including the random quantum circuit instances recently implemented on Google quantum chips. We find that the paths obtained can be very close to optimal, and often many orders or magnitude better than the most established approaches. As different underlying geometries suit different methods, we also introduce a hyper-optimization approach, where both the method applied and its algorithmic parameters are tuned during the path finding. The increase in quality of contraction schemes found has significant practical implications for the simulation of quantum many-body systems and particularly for the benchmarking of new quantum chips. Concretely, we estimate a speed-up of over 10,000\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes{\textbackslash} compared to the original expectation for the classical simulation of the Sycamore `supremacy' circuits.},

	abstract = {Transformer large language models ({LLMs}) have sparked admiration for their exceptional performance on tasks that demand intricate multi-step reasoning. Yet, these models simultaneously show failures on surprisingly trivial problems. This begs the question: Are these errors incidental, or do they signal more substantial limitations? In an attempt to demystify transformer {LLMs}, we investigate the limits of these models across three representative compositional tasks – multi-digit multiplication, logic grid puzzles, and a classic dynamic programming problem. These tasks require breaking problems down into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer. We formulate compositional tasks as computation graphs to systematically quantify the level of complexity, and break down reasoning steps into intermediate sub-procedures. Our empirical findings suggest that transformer {LLMs} solve compositional tasks by reducing multi-step compositional reasoning into linearized subgraph matching, without necessarily developing systematic problem-solving skills. To round off our empirical study, we provide theoretical arguments on abstract multi-step reasoning problems that highlight how autoregressive generations' performance can rapidly decay with{\textbackslash}textbackslash,increased{\textbackslash}textbackslash,task{\textbackslash}textbackslash,complexity.},

	abstract = {Tree tensor networks, or tree-based tensor formats, are prominent model classes for the approximation of high-dimensional functions in computational and data science. They correspond to sum-product neural networks with a sparse connectivity associated with a dimension tree and widths given by a tuple of tensor ranks. The approximation power of these models has been proved to be (near to) optimal for classical smoothness classes. However, in an empirical risk minimization framework with a limited number of observations, the dimension tree and ranks should be selected carefully to balance estimation and approximation errors. We propose and analyze a complexity-based model selection method for tree tensor networks in an empirical risk minimization framework and we analyze its performance over a wide range of smoothness classes. Given a family of model classes associated with different trees, ranks, tensor product feature spaces and sparsity patterns for sparse tensor networks, a model is selected ({\textbackslash}textbackslash`a la Barron, Birg{\textbackslash}textbackslash'e, Massart) by minimizing a penalized empirical risk, with a penalty depending on the complexity of the model class and derived from estimates of the metric entropy of tree tensor networks. This choice of penalty yields a risk bound for the selected predictor. In a least-squares setting, after deriving fast rates of convergence of the risk, we show that our strategy is (near to) minimax adaptive to a wide range of smoothness classes including Sobolev or Besov spaces (with isotropic, anisotropic or mixed dominating smoothness) and analytic functions. We discuss the role of sparsity of the tensor network for obtaining optimal performance in several regimes. In practice, the amplitude of the penalty is calibrated with a slope heuristics method. Numerical experiments in a least-squares regression setting illustrate the performance of the strategy.},

	abstract = {How can we model networks with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: heavy tails for the degree distribution; small diameters; and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Most present network models either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. In this paper we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have the above mentioned properties. Our main idea is to use the Kronecker product to generate graphs that we refer to as "Kronecker graphs". First, we prove that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present {KronFit}, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super- exponential time. In contrast, {KronFit} takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on large real and synthetic networks show that {KronFit} finds accurate parameters that indeed very well mimic the properties of target networks. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about the network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null- models, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.},

	abstract = {Autoregressive ({AR}) large language models ({LLMs}) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose Fast-{dLLM} v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model ({dLLM}) that efficiently adapts pretrained {AR} models into {dLLMs} for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion {LLMs} such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing {AR} training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-{dLLM} v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard {AR} decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-{dLLM} v2 matches or surpasses {AR} baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among {dLLMs} - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate {LLMs}.

This topological simplification has been measured by Betti numbers, which are algebraic invariants of a topological space. We use the same measure to establish lower and upper bounds on the topological simplification a {ReLU} neural network can achieve with a given architecture. We therefore contribute to a better understanding of the expressivity of {ReLU} neural networks in the context of binary classification problems by shedding light on their ability to capture the underlying topological structure of the data. In particular the results show that deep {ReLU} neural networks are exponentially more powerful than shallow ones in terms of topological simplification.

	abstract = {Dynamical low-rank approximation ({DLRA}) is a widely used paradigm for solving large-scale matrix differential equations, as they arise, for example, from the discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations on tensorized domains. Through orthogonally projecting the dynamics onto the tangent space of a low-dimensional manifold, {DLRA} achieves a significant reduction of the storage required to represent the solution. However, the need for evaluating the velocity field can make it challenging to attain a corresponding reduction of computational cost in the presence of nonlinearities. In this work, we address this challenge by replacing orthogonal tangent space projections with oblique, data-sparse projections selected by a discrete empirical interpolation method ({DEIM}). At the continuous-time level, this leads to {DLRA}-{DEIM}, a well-posed differential inclusion (in the Filippov sense) that captures the discontinuities induced by changes in the indices selected by {DEIM}. We establish an existence result, exactness property and error bound for {DLRA}-{DEIM} that match existing results for {DLRA}. For the particular case of {QDEIM}, a popular variant of {DEIM}, we provide an explicit convex-polytope characterization of the differential inclusion. Building on {DLRA}-{DEIM}, we propose a new class of projected integrators, called {PRK}-{DEIM}, that combines explicit Runge--Kutta methods with {DEIM}-based projections. We analyze the convergence order of {PRK}-{DEIM} and show that it matches the accuracy of previously proposed projected Runge-Kutta methods, while being significantly cheaper. Extensions to exponential Runge--Kutta methods and low-order tensor differential equations demonstrate the versatility of our framework.},

Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as {PDEs}-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space.

	abstract = {The tensor-train ({TT}) decomposition expresses a tensor in a data-sparse format used in molecular simulations, high-order correlation functions, and optimization. In this paper, we propose four parallelizable algorithms that compute the {TT} format from various tensor inputs: (1) Parallel-{TTSVD} for traditional format, (2) {PSTT} and its variants for streaming data, (3) Tucker2TT for Tucker format, and (4) {TT}-{fADI} for solutions of Sylvester tensor equations. We provide theoretical guarantees of accuracy, parallelization methods, scaling analysis, and numerical results. For example, for a \$d\$-dimension tensor in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{n{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}dots{\textbackslash}times n\}\$, a two-sided sketching algorithm {PSTT}2 is shown to have a memory complexity of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}lfloor d/2 {\textbackslash}rfloor\})\$, improving upon \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{d-1\})\$ from previous algorithms.},

In this method, the derivative is projected onto the tangent space of the manifold of tensors of Tucker rank \$(r\_1,{\textbackslash}dots,r\_N)\$ at the current approximation. This yields nonlinear differential equations for the factors in a Tucker decomposition, suitable for numerical integration. Approximation properties of this approach are analyzed.},

	abstract = {Dynamical low-rank approximation ({DLRA}) is a widely used paradigm for solving large-scale matrix differential equations, as they arise, for example, from the discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations on tensorized domains. Through orthogonally projecting the dynamics onto the tangent space of a low-dimensional manifold, {DLRA} achieves a significant reduction of the storage required to represent the solution. However, the need for evaluating the velocity field can make it challenging to attain a corresponding reduction of computational cost in the presence of nonlinearities. In this work, we address this challenge by replacing orthogonal tangent space projections with oblique, data-sparse projections selected by a discrete empirical interpolation method ({DEIM}). At the continuous-time level, this leads to {DLRA}-{DEIM}, a well-posed differential inclusion (in the Filippov sense) that captures the discontinuities induced by changes in the indices selected by {DEIM}. We establish an existence result, exactness property and error bound for {DLRA}-{DEIM} that match existing results for {DLRA}. For the particular case of {QDEIM}, a popular variant of {DEIM}, we provide an explicit convex-polytope characterization of the differential inclusion. Building on {DLRA}-{DEIM}, we propose a new class of projected integrators, called {PRK}-{DEIM}, that combines explicit Runge--Kutta methods with {DEIM}-based projections. We analyze the convergence order of {PRK}-{DEIM} and show that it matches the accuracy of previously proposed projected Runge-Kutta methods, while being significantly cheaper. Extensions to exponential Runge--Kutta methods and low-order tensor differential equations demonstrate the versatility of our framework.},

	abstract = {Progress in {AI} is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like {PyTorch} and {TensorFlow} provide automatic differentiation and efficient {GPU} implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for {AI}. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, {AI} languages like {LISP} and Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic {AI} at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical {AI} in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of {AI}.},

The inclusion of the new material has increased the length of the book from 500 to 600 pages; of the approximately 1000 references about 25\% have appeared since 1983. The greatest change has been the addition to the sparse treatment of Bayesian inference in the first edition. This includes the addition of new sections on Equivariant, Hierarchical, and Empirical Bayes, and on their comparisons. Other major additions deal with new developments concerning the information in equality and simultaneous and shrinkage estimation. The Notes at the end of each chapter now provide not only bibliographic and historical material but also introductions to recent development in point estimation and other related topics which, for space reasons, it was not possible to include in the main text. The problem sections also have been greatly expanded. On the other hand, to save space most of the discussion in the first edition on robust estimation (in particu lar L, M, and R estimators) has been deleted. This topic is the subject of two excellent books by Hampel et al (1986) and Staudte and Sheather (1990). Other than subject matter changes, there have been some minor modifications in the presentation.},

These distributions are power-law extensions of the usual exponential family and contain Student distributions as a special case. We then extend the notion of minimal sufficient statistics and compute it for these power-law families. Finally, we establish a Rao-Blackwell-type theorem for finding the best estimators for a power-law family. This helps us establish Cram\&amp;\#x00E9;r-Rao-type lower bounds for power-law families.},

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems—from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on {AlphaZero}1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, {AlphaTensor}, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. {AlphaTensor} discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where {AlphaTensor}’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of {AlphaTensor} through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight {AlphaTensor}’s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},
