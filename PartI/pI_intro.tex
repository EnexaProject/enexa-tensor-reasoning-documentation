\chapter{Introduction to \parref{par:one}}

The tensor formalism naturally captures the factored representation of a system, where the state of a system is determined by assignments to a fixed and finite set of variables.
Given these modelling assumptions, we review in \parref{par:one} based on the tensor formalism the two main paradigms of artificial intelligence to encode knowledge about a system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\ProbabilityTheory{}:} To each state we encode by a real number in $[0,1]$ its probability given our knowledge about a system.
    A probability distribution is therefore a tensor, which coordinates are in $[0,1]$ and sum to $1$.
    \item \textbf{\PropositionalLogic{}:} To each state we encode by a boolean its possibility given our knowledge about a system.
    A propositional knowledge base is therefore a tensor with boolean coordinates.
\end{itemize}

\sect{Sparse Representation and Interpretability}

The interpretability of machine learning models describing probabilistic and logical knowledge about a system is a central aspect of artificial intelligence.
In this work, we describe synergies between the interpretability and the sparse representation of a model by tensor networks.
%Both paradigms have developed human interpretable tools into the representation of and reasoning on knowledge.
Both the probabilistic and the logic approaches provide a human-understandable interface to machine learning:
\begin{itemize} % Graphical vs syntacical representation
    \item \textbf{Graphical representations in \probabilityTheory{}:} Probability distributions are interpreted based on the encoded conditional independencies between their categorical variables.
    In graphical models, the variable dependence structure is commonly represented by graphs, where variables are assigned to nodes and the edges represent dependencies.
    While generic probability distributions correspond with dense graphs, the central sparsity mechanism of \probabilityTheory{} relies on sparse graphs.
    Graphical models on sparse graphs are both representable by least resource demand and more accessible for human interpretation.
    Although variable dependencies provide coarse interpretations of a probability distributions, they do not offer a precise description of the distribution, since multiple distributions coincide in their variable dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Syntactical representations in \propositionalLogic{}:} Compared with \probabilityTheory{}, logical theories are more ambitious in providing human accessible interpretations.
    To this end, knowledge bases are verbalizable by logical syntax which is interpretable by humans.
    Categorical variables have leg dimension $2$ and are understood as atomic formulas, where the first index is interpreted as indicating a $\falsesymbol$ atomic formula and the second as a $\truesymbol$ atomic statement.
    More complex formulas, or propositional knowledge bases, are constructed by recursive combinations of the atomic formulas by logical connectives.
    This construction is reflected in the syntactical representation of knowledge bases.
    Compared with graphical descriptions of probability distributions, syntactical descriptions provide a precise description of the knowledge base with no representation freedom left.
\end{itemize}
Both the graphical and syntactical representation schemes show a synergy between the sparse representation of the knowledge about a system and the interpretability of that knowledge.
In \parref{par:one} we investigate two mechanisms to identify tensor network decompositions of probability distributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\IndependenceMechanism{}:}
    Conditional independence of random variables is a concept of \probabilityTheory{} and describes the absence of correlations between variables when conditioning on certain states of further variables.
    As we will show in \charef{prob:representation}, the absence of correlations corresponds with the existence of elementary decompositions of tensors representing probability distributions.
    While each conditional independence statement reflects a specific local decomposition mechanism, collections of conditional independence statements provide global tensor network decompositions of distributions.
    Graphical models visualize the independence structure of distributions in their graphical representation and the Hammersley-Clifford theorem ensures a corresponding tensor network decomposition.
    \item \textbf{\ComputationMechanism{}:}
    When there are sufficient statistics providing probabilities, we construct tensor networks decompositions by computation of the statistics.
    Whenever the functions to be computed are compositions of functions of lower numbers of arguments, we utilize these representations to construct tensor network decompositions.
    This mechanism motivates the representation of distributions by tensor networks, which contain a subnetwork computing a statistic and a subnetwork activating the statistic.
    We call such tensor networks \ComputationActivationNetworks{} and provide representations of probability distributions and propositional knowledge bases by them.
    In \propositionalLogic{}, statistics are provided by logical syntax as we will exploit in \charef{cha:logicalRepresentation}.
    In \probabilityTheory{}, we will make use of this approach in the efficient representation of sufficient statistics.
\end{itemize}
% Limitations to be mitigated
The representation schemes of \probabilityTheory{} and \propositionalLogic{} have limitations, which can be mitigated in a unifying tensor network framework.
While probability theory does not provide a human-understandable intuition about generic events, propositional syntax describes such events and is accessible for human interpretation.
\PropositionalLogic{} on the other hand has a limited expressivity, since it cannot express generic uncertainties about states.
This limitation is addressed by \probabilityTheory{}, which allows for the representation of distributions over the models of a knowledge base, thereby enhancing its expressivity.
Further expressivity limitations are overcome by more expressive logical frameworks such as \firstOrderLogic{} to be treated in \charef{cha:folModels}.
To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we adopt the tensor formalism as a unified framework towards hybrid representation and reasoning schemes investigated in \parref{par:two}.

\sect{Reasoning by Contractions}

In \parref{par:one}, we frame tensor network contractions as fundamental operation for reasoning in artificial intelligence.
In the probabilistic and logical approaches tensor network contractions appear as basic retrieval operations of knowledge about a system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\ProbabilityTheory{}:}
    % Marginal distributions
    The contraction of probability distributions is the central operation to compute marginal distributions.
    Here the contraction provides a sum over atomic events to calculate the probability of a combination of random variables being in a specific state.
    % Conditioning by normalization
    Conditioned probability distributions can be instantiated from normalized contractions of probability distributions with event indicator tensors.
    When contracting such conditioned probability distributions, the contraction calculates the conditional probability.
    \item \textbf{\PropositionalLogic{}:}
    % Satisfiability
    The contraction of knowledge bases is the central operation to count the number of possible states, or models, of the knowledge base.
    In such way, the satisfiability of a knowledge base can be decided on the positivity of the contraction.
    % Conjunctions
    Conjunctions of propositional formulas are on the other side represented by contractions leaving all atomic variables open.
    We can thus decide entailment by contracting such conjunctions with no open variables.
\end{itemize}
Based on these motivations, we formulate in this work all algorithms as orchestrations of contractions.

\sect{Outline}

We structure \parref{par:one} in four chapters dedicated to the foundations of probabilistic and logical methods of artificial intelligence.
In \charef{cha:probRepresentation} we investigate tensor network representations of probability distributions and review in \charef{cha:probReasoning} reasoning schemes based on contractions of these representations.
We then turn to syntactical representations of propositional knowledge bases in \charef{cha:logicalRepresentation} and show corresponding tensor network representations.
Based on probabilistic interpretations of these knowledge bases we then investigate logical reasoning schemes in \charef{cha:logicalReasoning}.
