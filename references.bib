	abstract = {A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {At the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and computer science sits the thriving field of compressive sensing. Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians.A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is build. With only moderate prerequisites, it is an excellent textbook for graduate courses in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. It also serves as a reliable resource for practitioners and researchers in these disciplines who want to acquire a careful understanding of the subject. A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing uses a mathematical perspective to present the core of the theory underlying compressive sensing.},

	abstract = {Recently, the format of TT tensors (Hackbusch and Kühn in J Fourier Anal Appl 15:706–722, 2009; Oseledets in SIAM J Sci Comput 2009, submitted; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in SIAM J Sci Comput 31:5, 2009; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in Linear Algebra Appl 2009, submitted) has turned out to be a promising new format for the approximation of solutions of high dimensional problems. In this paper, we prove some new results for the TT representation of a tensor U ∈ Rn1×···×nd and for the manifold of tensors of TT-rank r . As a ﬁrst result, we prove that the TT (or compression) ranks ri of a tensor U are unique and equal to the respective separation ranks of U if the components of the TT decomposition are required to fulﬁl a certain maximal rank condition. We then show that the set T of TT tensors of ﬁxed rank r locally forms an embedded manifold in Rn1×···×nd , therefore preserving the essential theoretical properties of the Tucker format, but often showing an improved scaling behaviour. Extending a similar approach for matrices (Conte and Lubich in M2AN 44:759, 2010), we introduce certain gauge conditions to obtain a unique representation of the tangent space TU T of T and deduce a local parametrization of the TT manifold. The parametrisation of TU T is often crucial for an algorithmic treatment of high-dimensional time-dependent PDEs and minimisation problems (Lubich in From quantum to classical molecular dynamics: reduced methods and numerical analysis, 2008). We conclude with remarks on those applications and present some numerical examples.},

Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, Graphical Models, Exponential Families and Variational Inference develops general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. It describes how a wide variety of algorithms- among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, and max-product-can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations.

	abstract = {This thesis contributes to the uniform concentration approach towards guaranteeing the generalization of learned models. We show probabilistic bounds on various uniform concentration events and demonstrate their utility in recovery guarantees. The thesis is organized in three parts.
In the first part, we develop a unified theoretical framework for the concentration of random variables and the uniform concentration of stochastic processes. We introduce functionals of stochastic processes and apply them in bounds on the supremum. Then we develop methods to transfer uniform concentration events into success guarantees for empirical risk minimization problems.
The second part of this thesis investigates classes of structured random distributions. More precisely, we derive bounds on the uniform concentration of contracted random tensors, which are decomposable into tensor network formats. In particular, we show exact moment bounds on contracted Gaussian tensor networks, which are tensor networks consistent of independent standard Gaussian random cores. By applying comparison theorems for Gaussian variables, the upper moment bounds are extended to more generic Orlicz tensor networks, which are characterized by weaker assumptions made on the random cores. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the concentration of Haar tensor networks, which random cores follow the Haar distribution of Stiefel manifolds. For all examples we continue to provide probabilistic bounds on uniform concentration events, which imply recovery guarantees for tensor regression problems. We further apply our findings in deriving success guarantees for efficient algorithms solving tensor regression problems.
In the third part, we transfer our findings to bounds on the uniform concentration of neural networks following two approaches. First, we derive concentration bounds for shallow ReLU networks with respect to standard Gaussian distributions, where we introduce parameter embeddings that capture the concentration structure. Second, we bound the Rademacher complexity of deep neural networks, which are activated by a contraction, by Rademacher complexities of linear functions. This enables the proof of recovery guarantees for neural networks, which are trained on structured data.},

Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efﬁciently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure.

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from the KB. These rules can help deduce and add missing knowledge to the KB. While ILP is a mature ﬁeld, mining logical rules from KBs is diﬀerent in two aspects: First, current rule mining systems are easily overwhelmed by the amount of data (state-of-the art systems cannot even run on today’s KBs). Second, ILP usually requires counterexamples. KBs, however, implement the open world assumption (OWA), meaning that absent data cannot be used as counterexamples. In this paper, we develop a rule mining model that is explicitly tailored to support the OWA scenario. It is inspired by association rule mining and introduces a novel measure for conﬁdence. Our extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and coverage. Furthermore, our system, AMIE, mines rules orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Most existing approaches for class expression learning in description logics are search algorithms. As the search space of these approaches is infinite, they often fail to scale to large learning problems. Our main intuition is that class expression learning can be regarded as a translation problem. Based thereupon, we propose a new family of class expression learning approaches which we dub neural class expression synthesis. Instances of this new family circumvent the high search costs entailed by current algorithms by translating training examples into class expressions in a fashion akin to machine translation solutions. Consequently, they are not subject to the runtime limitations of search-based approaches post training. We study three instances of this novel family of approaches to synthesize class expressions from sets of positive and negative examples. An evaluation of our approach on four benchmark datasets suggests that it can effectively synthesize high-quality class expressions with respect to the input examples in approximately one second on average. Moreover, a comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches suggests that we achieve better F-measures on large datasets. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our implementation as well as pretrained models in our public GitHub repository at https://github.com/fosterreproducibleresearch/NCES.},

                  q
               (DB) of matrix equations with a non-linear operation, where relations in M
               DB, the least Herbrand model of DB, are encoded as adjacency matrices. We then translate E
               
                  q
               (DB) into another, but purely linear matrix equations Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB). It is proved that the least solution of Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB) in the sense of matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of E
               
                  q
               (DB) and the latter gives M
               DB as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence, computing the least solution of Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB) is equivalent to computing M
               DB specified by DB. For a class of tail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach achieves O(N
               3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a clause since only matrix operations costing O(N
               3) or less are used. We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear Datalog programs. The first experiment computes transitive closure of artificial data and real network data taken from the Koblenz Network Collection. The second one compared the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art symbolic systems including two Prolog systems and two ASP systems, in terms of computation time for a transitive closure program and the same generation program. In the experiment, it is observed that our linear algebraic approach runs 101 {\textasciitilde} 104 times faster than the symbolic systems when data is not sparse. Our approach is inspired by the emergence of big knowledge graphs and expected to contribute to the realization of rich and scalable logical inference for knowledge graphs.},

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The ﬁrst is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google’s Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.},

First, we briefly review both models and discuss how their scoring functions are equivalent. We then analyze the discrepancy of results reported in the original articles, and show experimentally that they are likely due to the use of different loss functions. In further experiments, we evaluate the ability of both models to embed symmetric and antisymmetric patterns.

We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a uniﬁed learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions. Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2\% vs. 54.7\% by TransE on Freebase). Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as BornInCitypa, bq {\textasciicircum} CityInCountrypb, cq ùñ N ationalitypa, cq. We ﬁnd that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics, and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-ofthe-art conﬁdence-based rule mining approach in mining Horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.},

We present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic framework that supports querying, learning and reasoning with both rich data and abstract knowledge about the world. LTN introduces a fully differentiable logical language, called Real Logic, whereby the elements of a first-order logic signature are grounded onto data using neural computational graphs and first-order fuzzy logic semantics. We show that LTN provides a uniform language to represent and compute efficiently many of the most important AI tasks such as multi-label classification, relational learning, data clustering, semi-supervised learning, regression, embedding learning and query answering. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with several simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2.

This survey identifies seven shared dimensions between these two subfields of AI. These dimensions can be used to characterize different NeSy and StarAI systems. They are concerned with (1) the approach to logical inference, whether model or proof-based; (2) the syntax of the used logical theories; (3) the logical semantics of the systems and their extensions to facilitate learning; (4) the scope of learning, encompassing either parameter or structure learning; (5) the presence of symbolic and subsymbolic representations; (6) the degree to which systems capture the original logic, probabilistic, and neural paradigms; and (7) the classes of learning tasks the systems are applied to.

This leads to a close integration of probabilistic logical reasoning with deep-learning infrastructure: in particular, it enables high-performance deep learning frameworks to be used for tuning the parameters of a probabilistic logic. The integration with these frameworks enables use of GPU-based parallel processors for inference and learning, making TensorLog the first highly parallellizable probabilistic logic. Experimental results show that TensorLog scales to problems involving hundreds of thousands of knowledge-base triples and tens of thousands of examples.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a connectionist framework that is capable of representing and learning propositional knowledge. An extended version of propositional calculus is developed and is demonstrated to be useful for nonmonotonic reasoning, dealing with conflicting beliefs and for coping with inconsistency generated by unreliable knowledge sources. Formulas of the extended calculus are proved to be equivalent in a very strong sense to symmetric networks (like Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines), and efficient algorithms are given for translating back and forth between the two forms of knowledge representation. A fast learning procedure is presented that allows symmetric networks to learn representations of unknown logic formulas by looking at examples. A connectionist inference engine is then sketched whose knowledge is either compiled from a symbolic representation or learned inductively from training examples. Experiments with large scale randomly generated formulas suggest that the parallel local search that is executed by the networks is extremely fast on average. Finally, it is shown that the extended logic can be used as a high-level specification language for connectionist networks, into which several recent symbolic systems may be mapped. The paper demonstrates how a rigorous bridge can be constructed that ties together the (sometimes opposing) connectionist and symbolic approaches.},

Like Markov logic networks (MLNs), NMLNs are an exponential-family model for modelling distributions over possible worlds, but unlike MLNs, they do not rely on explicitly specified first-order logic rules. Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure. Similarly to many neural symbolic methods, NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants but, unlike them, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important for predicting in settings other than the transductive one. We showcase the potential of NMLNs on knowledge-base completion, triple classification and on generation of molecular (graph) data.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the approximation of high-dimensional functions in a statistical learning setting, by empirical risk minimization over model classes of functions in tree-based tensor format. These are particular classes of rank-structured functions that can be seen as deep neural networks with a sparse architecture related to the tree and multilinear activation functions. For learning in a given model class, we exploit the fact that tree-based tensor formats are multilinear models and recast the problem of risk minimization over a nonlinear set into a succession of learning problems with linear models. Suitable changes of representation yield numerically stable learning problems and allow to exploit sparsity. For high-dimensional problems or when only a small data set is available, the selection of a good model class is a critical issue. For a given tree, the selection of the tuple of tree-based ranks that minimize the risk is a combinatorial problem. Here, we propose a rank adaptation strategy which provides in practice a good convergence of the risk as a function of the model class complexity. Finding a good tree is also a combinatorial problem, which can be related to the choice of a particular sparse architecture for deep neural networks. Here, we propose a stochastic algorithm for minimizing the complexity of the representation of a given function over a class of trees with a given arity, allowing changes in the topology of the tree. This tree optimization algorithm is then included in a learning scheme that successively adapts the tree and the corresponding tree-based ranks. Contrary to classical learning algorithms for nonlinear model classes, the proposed algorithms are numerically stable, reliable, and require only a low level expertise of the user.},

Despite the increasing popularity of this type of queries, only limited efforts have been invested in their efficient evaluation. Motivated by recent results on the efficiency of worst-case optimal multi-way join algorithms for the evaluation of conjunctive queries, we present a novel multi-way join algorithm for the efficient evaluation of conjunctive regular path queries. The hallmark of our algorithm is the evaluation of the regular path queries found in conjunctive regular path queries using multi-way joins. This enables the exploitation of regular path queries in the planning steps of the proposed algorithm, which is crucial for the algorithm’s efficiency, as shown by the results of our detailed evaluation using the Wikidata-based benchmark WDBench. The results of this evaluation also show that our approach achieves a value of query mixes per hour that is 4.3 higher than the state of the art and that it outperforms all of the competing graph storage solutions in almost 70\% of the benchmark’s queries.},

The algorithm performs a beam or shortest-first search of the space of clauses, guided by a weighted pseudo-likelihood measure. This requires computing the optimal weights for each candidate structure, but we show how this can be done efficiently. The algorithm can be used to learn an MLN from scratch, or to refine an existing knowledge base. We have applied it in two real-world domains, and found that it outperforms using off-the-shelf ILP systems to learn the MLN structure, as well as pure ILP, purely probabilistic and purely knowledge-based approaches.},

	abstract = {A robot that can be simply told in natural language what to do -- this has been one of the ultimate long-standing goals in both Artificial Intelligence and Robotics research. In near-future applications, robotic assistants and companions will have to understand and perform commands such as set the table for dinner'', make pancakes for breakfast'', or cut the pizza into 8 pieces.'' Although such instructions are only vaguely formulated, complex sequences of sophisticated and accurate manipulation activities need to be carried out in order to accomplish the respective tasks. The acquisition of knowledge about how to perform these activities from huge collections of natural-language instructions from the Internet has garnered a lot of attention within the last decade. However, natural language is typically massively unspecific, incomplete, ambiguous and vague and thus requires powerful means for interpretation. This work presents PRAC -- Probabilistic Action Cores -- an interpreter for natural-language instructions which is able to resolve vagueness and ambiguity in natural language and infer missing information pieces that are required to render an instruction executable by a robot. To this end, PRAC formulates the problem of instruction interpretation as a reasoning problem in first-order probabilistic knowledge bases. In particular, the system uses Markov logic networks as a carrier formalism for encoding uncertain knowledge. A novel framework for reasoning about unmodeled symbolic concepts is introduced, which incorporates ontological knowledge from taxonomies and exploits semantically similar relational structures in a domain of discourse. The resulting reasoning framework thus enables more compact representations of knowledge and exhibits strong generalization performance when being learnt from very sparse data. Furthermore, a novel approach for completing directives is presented, which applies semantic analogical reasoning to transfer knowledge collected from thousands of natural-language instruction sheets to new situations. In addition, a cohesive processing pipeline is described that transforms vague and incomplete task formulations into sequences of formally specified robot plans. The system is connected to a plan executive that is able to execute the computed plans in a simulator. Experiments conducted in a publicly accessible, browser-based web interface showcase that PRAC is capable of closing the loop from natural-language instructions to their execution by a robot.},

Compared to machine learning methods they are more reliable and human-interpretable but scale poorly on large KGs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to dramatically speed up the process of detecting and explaining inconsistency in large KGs by exploiting KG abstractions that capture prominent data patterns. Though much smaller, KG abstractions preserve inconsistency and their explanations.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two, leading to a more general form of Clifford algebras named degenerate Clifford algebras. This generalization to degenerate Clifford algebras does allow for covering dual numbers and as such include translations and rotations models under the same generalization paradigm for the first time. We develop two models to determine the parameters that define the algebra: one using a greedy search and another predicting the parameters based on neural network embeddings of the input knowledge graph. Our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets demonstrates that this incorporation of nilpotent vectors enhances the quality of embeddings. Additionally, our method outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches in terms of generalization, particularly regarding the mean reciprocal rank achieved on validation data. Finally, we show that even a simple greedy search can effectively discover optimal or near-optimal parameters for the algebra.},

In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues.

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

Knowledge graphs are founded on the principle of applying a graph-based abstraction to data, and are now broadly deployed in scenarios that require integrating and extracting value from multiple, diverse sources of data at large scale. The book defines knowledge graphs and provides a high-level overview of how they are used. It presents and contrasts popular graph models that are commonly used to represent data as graphs, and the languages by which they can be queried before describing how the resulting data graph can be enhanced with notions of schema, identity, and context. The book discusses how ontologies and rules can be used to encode knowledge as well as how inductive techniques—based on statistics, graph analytics, machine learning, etc.—can be used to encode and extract knowledge. It covers techniques for the creation, enrichment, assessment, and refinement of knowledge graphs and surveys recent open and enterprise knowledge graphs and the industries or applications within which they have been most widely adopted. The book closes by discussing the current limitations and future directions along which knowledge graphs are likely to evolve. This book is aimed at students, researchers, and practitioners who wish to learn more about knowledge graphs and how they facilitate extracting value from diverse data at large scale.

In recent years, Bayesian methods have emerged as a popular direction for analyzing tensor-valued data since they provide a convenient way to introduce sparsity into the model and conduct uncertainty quantification. In this article, we provide an overview of frequentist and Bayesian methods for solving tensor completion and regression problems, with a focus on Bayesian methods. We review common Bayesian tensor approaches including model formulation, prior assignment, posterior computation, and theoretical properties. We also discuss potential future directions in this field.},

	isbn = {978-0-9749039-4-1},
	abstract = {Parameter estimation in Markov random fields (MRFs) is a difficult task, in which inference over the network is run in the inner loop of a gradient descent procedure. Replacing exact inference with approximate methods such as loopy belief propagation (LBP) can suffer from poor convergence. In this paper, we provide a different approach for combining MRF learning and Bethe approximation. We consider the dual of maximum likelihood Markov network learning — maximizing entropy with moment matching constraints — and then approximate both the objective and the constraints in the resulting optimization problem. Unlike previous work along these lines (Teh \&amp; Welling, 2003), our formulation allows parameter sharing between features in a general log-linear model, parameter regularization and conditional training. We show that piecewise training (Sutton \&amp; McCallum, 2005) is a very restricted special case of this formulation. We study two optimization strategies: one based on a single convex approximation and one that uses repeated convex approximations. We show results on several real-world networks that demonstrate that these algorithms can significantly outperform learning with loopy and piece-wise. Our results also provide a framework for analyzing the trade-offs of different relaxations of the entropy objective and of the constraints.},

The reconstruction procedure is then based on one of the associated dual frames, which—in the case of a Parseval frame—can be chosen to be the frame itself. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the basics of finite frame theory upon which the subsequent chapters are based. After recalling some background information on Hilbert space theory and operator theory, we introduce the notion of a frame along with some crucial properties and construction procedures. Then we discuss algorithmic aspects such as basic reconstruction algorithms and present brief introductions to diverse applications and extensions of frames. The subsequent chapters of this book will then extend key topics in many intriguing directions.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty-and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition-in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.},

A detailed analysis is given of "elementary" cellular automata consisting of a sequence of sites with values 0 or 1 on a line, with each site evolving deterministically in discrete time steps according to definite rules involving the values of its nearest neighbors. With simple initial configurations, the cellular automata either tend to homogeneous states, or generate self-similar patterns with fractal dimensions ≃ 1.59 or ≃ 1.69. With "random" initial configurations, the irreversible character of the cellular automaton evolution leads to several self-organization phenomena. Statistical properties of the structures generated are found to lie in two universality classes, independent of the details of the initial state or the cellular automaton rules. More complicated cellular automata are briefly considered, and connections with dynamical systems theory and the formal theory of computation are discussed.},

	abstract = {0/1-Polytopen kann man in vielen Gebieten der diskreten Mathematik begegnen. Das bekannteste ist als "polyedrische Kombinatorik" bekannt. Auch wenn man die polyedrische Kombinatorik meist mit kombinatorischer Optimierung in Verbindung bringt, gibt es wichtige Zusammenhänge zu anderen Gebieten, zum Beispiel zum Zählen von kombinatorischen Strukturen. Trotz ihres breiten Anwendungsspektrums existiert keine umfassende Theorie über 0/1-Polytope. Es scheint so als seien 0/1-Polytope besonders komplizierte Objekte. Die Ergebnisse, welche in dieser Dissertation dargestellt werden, gruppieren sich um drei Hauptthemen: (1) obere Schranken für die minimale Anzahl von Seiten (Kanten und Facetten), (2) eine Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani über die Kantenexpansion und (3) zufällige 0/1-Polytope. Zufälligen 0/1-Polytope können aus zwei verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachtet werden. Zum einen kann man Zufall benutzen, um die Komplexität allgemeiner 0/1-Polytope zu durchbrechen. Zum anderen kann man untersuchen, welche Eigenschaften zufällige 0/1-Polytope mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit besitzen. Dies sind dann typische Eigenschaften von 0/1-Polytopen und können nützlich sein, um Eigenschaften spezieller 0/1-Polytope einzuordnen. Nach einer kurzen Einführung in die Grundlagen der Polytoptheorie und einen Überblick über den aktuellen Stand der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der 0/1-Polytope, werden Grundlagen aus der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie kurz eingeführt. Die Ergebnisse zu zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen (3) umfassen: (a) Schwellenwert Resultate mit exponentieller Konvergenz zu der Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass \$k\$ zufällige Ecken eines zufälligen 0/1-Polytopes eine \$(k-1)\$-dimensionale Seite bilden; (b) Es gibt 0/1-Polytope mit exponentiell kleiner Eckenexpansion; (c) für jedes \$k\$ gibt es eine Konstante \$c\_k\$, so dass ein zufälliges 0/1-Polytop in \$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$ mit höchstens \$2{\textasciicircum}\{cd\}\$ Ecken sehr wahrscheinlich \$k\$-nachbarschaftlich ist. Ergebnis (b) zeigt, dass es für die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2) nicht genügt die Eckenexpansion zu untersuchen. Allerdings scheint es schwierig oder unmöglich zu sein, dieses Negativresultat auf die Kantenexpansion auszuweiten. Ergebnisse (a) und (c) zeigen typische Eigenschaften von zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass ein vollständiger Graph für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung nichts besonderes sind, da diese Polytope meistens nur sub-exponentiell viele Ecken haben. Bekannte Beispiele für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung sind Traveling Salesman Polytope'' und Cut-Polytope''. Im letzten Kapitel stellen wir revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope vor. Diese speziellen Knap{\textbackslash}-sack-Poly{\textbackslash}-tope haben sehr wenige Facetten und Kanten. Wir benutzen diese Polytope, um zu zeigen, dass es in jeder Dimension \$d\$ und sinnvoller Eckenzahl \$n\$ ein \$d\$-dimensionales 0/1-Polytope mit \$n\$ Ecken gibt, welches höchstens \$3d\$ Facetten und Eckengrad höchstens \$d+8\$ hat. Dies sind die ersten Resultate zu oberen Schranken an die minimale Anzahl der Seiten von 0/1-Polytopen (1). Trotz des dünnen Graphen erfüllen diese 0/1-Polytope die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2). Abschließend betrachten wir noch kurz "erweiterte revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope", welche eine weiterführende Richtung in der Untersuchung von Knapsack-Polytopen im Hinblick auf die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani sein können.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional probability offers insight into the behavior of random vectors, random matrices, random subspaces, and objects used to quantify uncertainty in high dimensions. Drawing on ideas from probability, analysis, and geometry, it lends itself to applications in mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, signal processing, optimization, and more. It is the first to integrate theory, key tools, and modern applications of high-dimensional probability. Concentration inequalities form the core, and it covers both classical results such as Hoeffding's and Chernoff's inequalities and modern developments such as the matrix Bernstein's inequality. It then introduces the powerful methods based on stochastic processes, including such tools as Slepian's, Sudakov's, and Dudley's inequalities, as well as generic chaining and bounds based on VC dimension. A broad range of illustrations is embedded throughout, including classical and modern results for covariance estimation, clustering, networks, semidefinite programming, coding, dimension reduction, matrix completion, machine learning, compressed sensing, and sparse regression.},

	abstract = {Description logics (DLs) have a long tradition in computer science and knowledge representation, being designed so that domain knowledge can be described and so that computers can reason about this knowledge. DLs have recently gained increased importance since they form the logical basis of widely used ontology languages, in particular the web ontology language OWL. Written by four renowned experts, this is the first textbook on description logics. It is suitable for self-study by graduates and as the basis for a university course. Starting from a basic DL, the book introduces the reader to their syntax, semantics, reasoning problems and model theory and discusses the computational complexity of these reasoning problems and algorithms to solve them. It then explores a variety of reasoning techniques, knowledge-based applications and tools and it describes the relationship between DLs and OWL.},

	abstract = {Description logics are embodied in several knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various real-life applications. Now in paperback, The Description Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject, covering all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory, implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be broad, ranging from more theoretically oriented readers, to those with more practically oriented interests who need a sound and modern understanding of knowledge representation systems based on description logics. As well as general revision throughout the book, this new edition presents a new chapter on ontology languages for the semantic web, an area of great importance for the future development of the web. In sum, the book will serve as a unique resource for the subject, and can also be used for self-study or as a reference for knowledge representation and artificial intelligence courses.},

	abstract = {We study extensions of compressive sensing and low rank matrix recovery to the recovery of tensors of low rank from incomplete linear information. While the reconstruction of low rank matrices via nuclear norm minimization is rather well-understand by now, almost no theory is available so far for the extension to higher order tensors due to various theoretical and computational difficulties arising for tensor decompositions. In fact, nuclear norm minimization for matrix recovery is a tractable convex relaxation approach, but the extension of the nuclear norm to tensors is in general NP-hard to compute. In this article, we introduce convex relaxations of the tensor nuclear norm which are computable in polynomial time via semidefinite programming. Our approach is based on theta bodies, a concept from real computational algebraic geometry which is similar to the one of the better known Lasserre relaxations. We introduce polynomial ideals which are generated by the second-order minors corresponding to different matricizations of the tensor (where the tensor entries are treated as variables) such that the nuclear norm ball is the convex hull of the algebraic variety of the ideal. The theta body of order k for such an ideal generates a new norm which we call the θk-norm. We show that in the matrix case, these norms reduce to the standard nuclear norm. For tensors of order three or higher however, we indeed obtain new norms. The sequence of the corresponding unit-θk-norm balls converges asymptotically to the unit tensor nuclear norm ball. By providing the Gröbner basis for the ideals, we explicitly give semidefinite programs for the computation of the θk-norm and for the minimization of the θk-norm under an affine constraint. Finally, numerical experiments for order-three tensor recovery via θ1-norm minimization suggest that our approach successfully reconstructs tensors of low rank from incomplete linear (random) measurements.},
