	abstract = {Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts of multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality. Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks (TNs) and tensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets of factor (component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect relationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale TDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection, feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series analysis and multiway component analysis.

There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.},

In this paper, we argue that the naive approach to this problem is doomed to failure because, unlike matrices, tensors of order 3 or higher can fail to have best rank-r approximations. The phenomenon is much more widespread than one might suspect: examples of this failure can be constructed over a wide range of dimensions, orders and ranks, regardless of the choice of norm (or even Br`egman divergence). Moreover, we show that in many instances these counterexamples have positive volume: they cannot be regarded as isolated phenomena. In one extreme case, we exhibit a tensor space in which no rank-3 tensor has an optimal rank-2 approximation. The notable exceptions to this misbehavior are rank-1 tensors and order-2 tensors (i.e. matrices).},

This hierarchical SVD has properties like the matrix SVD (and collapses to the SVD in d = 2), and we prove these. In particular, one can find low rank (almost) best approximations in a hierarchical format (H-Tucker) which requires only O((d - 1)k3 + dnk) parameters, where d is the order of the tensor, n the size of the modes, and k the (hierarchical) rank. The H-Tucker format is a specialization of the Tucker format and it contains as a special case all (canonical) rank k tensors. Based on this new concept of a hierarchical SVD we present algorithms for hierarchical tensor calculations allowing for a rigorous error analysis. The complexity of the truncation (finding lower rank approximations to hierarchical rank k tensors) is in O((d-1)k4+dnk2) and the attainable accuracy is just 2-3 digits less than machine precision.},

	abstract = {Recently, the format of TT tensors (Hackbusch and Kühn in J Fourier Anal Appl 15:706–722, 2009; Oseledets in SIAM J Sci Comput 2009, submitted; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in SIAM J Sci Comput 31:5, 2009; Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov in Linear Algebra Appl 2009, submitted) has turned out to be a promising new format for the approximation of solutions of high dimensional problems. In this paper, we prove some new results for the TT representation of a tensor U ∈ Rn1×···×nd and for the manifold of tensors of TT-rank r . As a ﬁrst result, we prove that the TT (or compression) ranks ri of a tensor U are unique and equal to the respective separation ranks of U if the components of the TT decomposition are required to fulﬁl a certain maximal rank condition. We then show that the set T of TT tensors of ﬁxed rank r locally forms an embedded manifold in Rn1×···×nd , therefore preserving the essential theoretical properties of the Tucker format, but often showing an improved scaling behaviour. Extending a similar approach for matrices (Conte and Lubich in M2AN 44:759, 2010), we introduce certain gauge conditions to obtain a unique representation of the tangent space TU T of T and deduce a local parametrization of the TT manifold. The parametrisation of TU T is often crucial for an algorithmic treatment of high-dimensional time-dependent PDEs and minimisation problems (Lubich in From quantum to classical molecular dynamics: reduced methods and numerical analysis, 2008). We conclude with remarks on those applications and present some numerical examples.},

Many problems that arise in specific instances-including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions-are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, Graphical Models, Exponential Families and Variational Inference develops general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. It describes how a wide variety of algorithms- among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, and max-product-can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

	abstract = {This thesis contributes to the uniform concentration approach towards guaranteeing the generalization of learned models. We show probabilistic bounds on various uniform concentration events and demonstrate their utility in recovery guarantees. The thesis is organized in three parts.
In the first part, we develop a unified theoretical framework for the concentration of random variables and the uniform concentration of stochastic processes. We introduce functionals of stochastic processes and apply them in bounds on the supremum. Then we develop methods to transfer uniform concentration events into success guarantees for empirical risk minimization problems.
The second part of this thesis investigates classes of structured random distributions. More precisely, we derive bounds on the uniform concentration of contracted random tensors, which are decomposable into tensor network formats. In particular, we show exact moment bounds on contracted Gaussian tensor networks, which are tensor networks consistent of independent standard Gaussian random cores. By applying comparison theorems for Gaussian variables, the upper moment bounds are extended to more generic Orlicz tensor networks, which are characterized by weaker assumptions made on the random cores. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the concentration of Haar tensor networks, which random cores follow the Haar distribution of Stiefel manifolds. For all examples we continue to provide probabilistic bounds on uniform concentration events, which imply recovery guarantees for tensor regression problems. We further apply our findings in deriving success guarantees for efficient algorithms solving tensor regression problems.
In the third part, we transfer our findings to bounds on the uniform concentration of neural networks following two approaches. First, we derive concentration bounds for shallow ReLU networks with respect to standard Gaussian distributions, where we introduce parameter embeddings that capture the concentration structure. Second, we bound the Rademacher complexity of deep neural networks, which are activated by a contraction, by Rademacher complexities of linear functions. This enables the proof of recovery guarantees for neural networks, which are trained on structured data.},

Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it speciﬁes a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a ﬁrst-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efﬁciently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (KBs), which capture knowledge in a machine-readable format. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from the KB. These rules can help deduce and add missing knowledge to the KB. While ILP is a mature ﬁeld, mining logical rules from KBs is diﬀerent in two aspects: First, current rule mining systems are easily overwhelmed by the amount of data (state-of-the art systems cannot even run on today’s KBs). Second, ILP usually requires counterexamples. KBs, however, implement the open world assumption (OWA), meaning that absent data cannot be used as counterexamples. In this paper, we develop a rule mining model that is explicitly tailored to support the OWA scenario. It is inspired by association rule mining and introduces a novel measure for conﬁdence. Our extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and coverage. Furthermore, our system, AMIE, mines rules orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Most existing approaches for class expression learning in description logics are search algorithms. As the search space of these approaches is infinite, they often fail to scale to large learning problems. Our main intuition is that class expression learning can be regarded as a translation problem. Based thereupon, we propose a new family of class expression learning approaches which we dub neural class expression synthesis. Instances of this new family circumvent the high search costs entailed by current algorithms by translating training examples into class expressions in a fashion akin to machine translation solutions. Consequently, they are not subject to the runtime limitations of search-based approaches post training. We study three instances of this novel family of approaches to synthesize class expressions from sets of positive and negative examples. An evaluation of our approach on four benchmark datasets suggests that it can effectively synthesize high-quality class expressions with respect to the input examples in approximately one second on average. Moreover, a comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches suggests that we achieve better F-measures on large datasets.

	abstract = {We propose a fundamentally new approach to Datalog evaluation. Given a linear Datalog program DB written using N constants and binary predicates, we first translate if-and-only-if completions of clauses in DB into a set E
               
                  q
               (DB) of matrix equations with a non-linear operation, where relations in M
               DB, the least Herbrand model of DB, are encoded as adjacency matrices. We then translate E
               
                  q
               (DB) into another, but purely linear matrix equations Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB). It is proved that the least solution of Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB) in the sense of matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of E
               
                  q
               (DB) and the latter gives M
               DB as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence, computing the least solution of Ẽ
               
                  q
               (DB) is equivalent to computing M
               DB specified by DB. For a class of tail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach achieves O(N
               3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a clause since only matrix operations costing O(N
               3) or less are used. We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear Datalog programs. The first experiment computes transitive closure of artificial data and real network data taken from the Koblenz Network Collection. The second one compared the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art symbolic systems including two Prolog systems and two ASP systems, in terms of computation time for a transitive closure program and the same generation program. In the experiment, it is observed that our linear algebraic approach runs 101 {\textasciitilde} 104 times faster than the symbolic systems when data is not sparse. Our approach is inspired by the emergence of big knowledge graphs and expected to contribute to the realization of rich and scalable logical inference for knowledge graphs.},

In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be “trained” on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The ﬁrst is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google’s Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.},

First, we briefly review both models and discuss how their scoring functions are equivalent. We then analyze the discrepancy of results reported in the original articles, and show experimentally that they are likely due to the use of different loss functions.

We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a uniﬁed learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions. Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2\% vs. 54.7\% by TransE on Freebase). Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as BornInCitypa, bq {\textasciicircum} CityInCountrypb, cq ùñ N ationalitypa, cq. We ﬁnd that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics, and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-ofthe-art conﬁdence-based rule mining approach in mining Horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.},

In a neurosymbolic system, symbolic knowledge assists deep learning, which typically uses a sub-symbolic distributed representation, to learn and reason at a higher level of abstraction. We present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic framework that supports querying, learning and reasoning with both rich data and abstract knowledge about the world. LTN introduces a fully differentiable logical language, called Real Logic, whereby the elements of a first-order logic signature are grounded onto data using neural computational graphs and first-order fuzzy logic semantics. We show that LTN provides a uniform language to represent and compute efficiently many of the most important AI tasks such as multi-label classification, relational learning, data clustering, semi-supervised learning, regression, embedding learning and query answering. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with several simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2. The results indicate that LTN can be a general and powerful framework for neurosymbolic AI.},

This survey identifies seven shared dimensions between these two subfields of AI. These dimensions can be used to characterize different NeSy and StarAI systems. They are concerned with (1) the approach to logical inference, whether model or proof-based; (2) the syntax of the used logical theories; (3) the logical semantics of the systems and their extensions to facilitate learning; (4) the scope of learning, encompassing either parameter or structure learning; (5) the presence of symbolic and subsymbolic representations; (6) the degree to which systems capture the original logic, probabilistic, and neural paradigms; and (7) the classes of learning tasks the systems are applied to. By positioning various NeSy and StarAI systems along these dimensions and pointing out similarities and differences between them, this survey contributes fundamental concepts for understanding the integration of learning and reasoning.},

An extended version of propositional calculus is developed and is demonstrated to be useful for nonmonotonic reasoning, dealing with conflicting beliefs and for coping with inconsistency generated by unreliable knowledge sources. Formulas of the extended calculus are proved to be equivalent in a very strong sense to symmetric networks (like Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines), and efficient algorithms are given for translating back and forth between the two forms of knowledge representation. A fast learning procedure is presented that allows symmetric networks to learn representations of unknown logic formulas by looking at examples. A connectionist inference engine is then sketched whose knowledge is either compiled from a symbolic representation or learned inductively from training examples. Experiments with large scale randomly generated formulas suggest that the parallel local search that is executed by the networks is extremely fast on average. Finally, it is shown that the extended logic can be used as a high-level specification language for connectionist networks, into which several recent symbolic systems may be mapped. The paper demonstrates how a rigorous bridge can be constructed that ties together the (sometimes opposing) connectionist and symbolic approaches.},

Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure. Similarly to many neural symbolic methods, NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants but, unlike them, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important for predicting in settings other than the transductive one.

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the approximation of high-dimensional functions in a statistical learning setting, by empirical risk minimization over model classes of functions in tree-based tensor format. These are particular classes of rank-structured functions that can be seen as deep neural networks with a sparse architecture related to the tree and multilinear activation functions. For learning in a given model class, we exploit the fact that tree-based tensor formats are multilinear models and recast the problem of risk minimization over a nonlinear set into a succession of learning problems with linear models. Suitable changes of representation yield numerically stable learning problems and allow to exploit sparsity. For high-dimensional problems or when only a small data set is available, the selection of a good model class is a critical issue. For a given tree, the selection of the tuple of tree-based ranks that minimize the risk is a combinatorial problem. Here, we propose a rank adaptation strategy which provides in practice a good convergence of the risk as a function of the model class complexity. Finding a good tree is also a combinatorial problem, which can be related to the choice of a particular sparse architecture for deep neural networks. Here, we propose a stochastic algorithm for minimizing the complexity of the representation of a given function over a class of trees with a given arity, allowing changes in the topology of the tree. This tree optimization algorithm is then included in a learning scheme that successively adapts the tree and the corresponding tree-based ranks. Contrary to classical learning algorithms for nonlinear model classes, the proposed algorithms are numerically stable, reliable, and require only a low level expertise of the user.},

Despite the increasing popularity of this type of queries, only limited efforts have been invested in their efficient evaluation. Motivated by recent results on the efficiency of worst-case optimal multi-way join algorithms for the evaluation of conjunctive queries, we present a novel multi-way join algorithm for the efficient evaluation of conjunctive regular path queries. The hallmark of our algorithm is the evaluation of the regular path queries found in conjunctive regular path queries using multi-way joins. This enables the exploitation of regular path queries in the planning steps of the proposed algorithm, which is crucial for the algorithm’s efficiency, as shown by the results of our detailed evaluation using the Wikidata-based benchmark WDBench. The results of this evaluation also show that our approach achieves a value of query mixes per hour that is 4.3 higher than the state of the art and that it outperforms all of the competing graph storage solutions in almost 70\% of the benchmark’s queries.},

In this paper we develop an algorithm for learning the structure of MLNs from relational databases, combining ideas from inductive logic programming (ILP) and feature induction in Markov networks. The algorithm performs a beam or shortest-first search of the space of clauses, guided by a weighted pseudo-likelihood measure. This requires computing the optimal weights for each candidate structure, but we show how this can be done efficiently. The algorithm can be used to learn an MLN from scratch, or to refine an existing knowledge base. We have applied it in two real-world domains, and found that it outperforms using off-the-shelf ILP systems to learn the MLN structure, as well as pure ILP, purely probabilistic and purely knowledge-based approaches.},

	abstract = {A robot that can be simply told in natural language what to do -- this has been one of the ultimate long-standing goals in both Artificial Intelligence and Robotics research. In near-future applications, robotic assistants and companions will have to understand and perform commands such as set the table for dinner'', make pancakes for breakfast'', or cut the pizza into 8 pieces.'' Although such instructions are only vaguely formulated, complex sequences of sophisticated and accurate manipulation activities need to be carried out in order to accomplish the respective tasks. The acquisition of knowledge about how to perform these activities from huge collections of natural-language instructions from the Internet has garnered a lot of attention within the last decade. However, natural language is typically massively unspecific, incomplete, ambiguous and vague and thus requires powerful means for interpretation. This work presents PRAC -- Probabilistic Action Cores -- an interpreter for natural-language instructions which is able to resolve vagueness and ambiguity in natural language and infer missing information pieces that are required to render an instruction executable by a robot. To this end, PRAC formulates the problem of instruction interpretation as a reasoning problem in first-order probabilistic knowledge bases. In particular, the system uses Markov logic networks as a carrier formalism for encoding uncertain knowledge. A novel framework for reasoning about unmodeled symbolic concepts is introduced, which incorporates ontological knowledge from taxonomies and exploits semantically similar relational structures in a domain of discourse. The resulting reasoning framework thus enables more compact representations of knowledge and exhibits strong generalization performance when being learnt from very sparse data. Furthermore, a novel approach for completing directives is presented, which applies semantic analogical reasoning to transfer knowledge collected from thousands of natural-language instruction sheets to new situations. In addition, a cohesive processing pipeline is described that transforms vague and incomplete task formulations into sequences of formally specified robot plans. The system is connected to a plan executive that is able to execute the computed plans in a simulator. Experiments conducted in a publicly accessible, browser-based web interface showcase that PRAC is capable of closing the loop from natural-language instructions to their execution by a robot.},

Prominent solutions detect and explain inconsistency in KGs with respect to accompanying ontologies that describe the KG domain of interest. Compared to machine learning methods they are more reliable and human-interpretable but scale poorly on large KGs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to dramatically speed up the process of detecting and explaining inconsistency in large KGs by exploiting KG abstractions that capture prominent data patterns. Though much smaller, KG abstractions preserve inconsistency and their explanations. Our experiments with large KGs (e.g., DBpedia and Yago) demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and show that it significantly outperforms the popular baseline.},

Previous research in knowledge graph embeddings has focused exclusively on Clifford algebras of a specific type, which do not include nilpotent base vectors—elements that square to zero. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two, leading to a more general form of Clifford algebras named degenerate Clifford algebras. This generalization to degenerate Clifford algebras does allow for covering dual numbers and as such include translations and rotations models under the same generalization paradigm for the first time. We develop two models to determine the parameters that define the algebra: one using a greedy search and another predicting the parameters based on neural network embeddings of the input knowledge graph. Our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets demonstrates that this incorporation of nilpotent vectors enhances the quality of embeddings. Additionally, our method outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches in terms of generalization, particularly regarding the mean reciprocal rank achieved on validation data. Finally, we show that even a simple greedy search can effectively discover optimal or near-optimal parameters for the algebra.},

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues. Numerous applications are provided throughout.},

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

Knowledge graphs are founded on the principle of applying a graph-based abstraction to data, and are now broadly deployed in scenarios that require integrating and extracting value from multiple, diverse sources of data at large scale. The book defines knowledge graphs and provides a high-level overview of how they are used. It presents and contrasts popular graph models that are commonly used to represent data as graphs, and the languages by which they can be queried before describing how the resulting data graph can be enhanced with notions of schema, identity, and context. The book discusses how ontologies and rules can be used to encode knowledge as well as how inductive techniques—based on statistics, graph analytics, machine learning, etc.—can be used to encode and extract knowledge. It covers techniques for the creation, enrichment, assessment, and refinement of knowledge graphs and surveys recent open and enterprise knowledge graphs and the industries or applications within which they have been most widely adopted. The book closes by discussing the current limitations and future directions along which knowledge graphs are likely to evolve. This book is aimed at students, researchers, and practitioners who wish to learn more about knowledge graphs and how they facilitate extracting value from diverse data at large scale. To make the book accessible for newcomers, running examples and graphical notation are used throughout.

Replacing exact inference with approximate methods such as loopy belief propagation (LBP) can suffer from poor convergence. In this paper, we provide a different approach for combining MRF learning and Bethe approximation. We consider the dual of maximum likelihood Markov network learning — maximizing entropy with moment matching constraints — and then approximate both the objective and the constraints in the resulting optimization problem. Unlike previous work along these lines (Teh \&amp; Welling, 2003), our formulation allows parameter sharing between features in a general log-linear model, parameter regularization and conditional training. We show that piecewise training (Sutton \&amp; McCallum, 2005) is a very restricted special case of this formulation. We study two optimization strategies: one based on a single convex approximation and one that uses repeated convex approximations. We show results on several real-world networks that demonstrate that these algorithms can significantly outperform learning with loopy and piece-wise. Our results also provide a framework for analyzing the trade-offs of different relaxations of the entropy objective and of the constraints.},

The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty-and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation.

	abstract = {Cellular automata are used as simple mathematical models to investigate self-organization in statistical mechanics. A detailed analysis is given of "elementary" cellular automata consisting of a sequence of sites with values 0 or 1 on a line, with each site evolving deterministically in discrete time steps according to definite rules involving the values of its nearest neighbors. With simple initial configurations, the cellular automata either tend to homogeneous states, or generate self-similar patterns with fractal dimensions ≃ 1.59 or ≃ 1.69. With "random" initial configurations, the irreversible character of the cellular automaton evolution leads to several self-organization phenomena. Statistical properties of the structures generated are found to lie in two universality classes, independent of the details of the initial state or the cellular automaton rules. More complicated cellular automata are briefly considered, and connections with dynamical systems theory and the formal theory of computation are discussed.},

Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail.

	abstract = {0/1-Polytopen kann man in vielen Gebieten der diskreten Mathematik begegnen. Das bekannteste ist als "polyedrische Kombinatorik" bekannt. Auch wenn man die polyedrische Kombinatorik meist mit kombinatorischer Optimierung in Verbindung bringt, gibt es wichtige Zusammenhänge zu anderen Gebieten, zum Beispiel zum Zählen von kombinatorischen Strukturen. Trotz ihres breiten Anwendungsspektrums existiert keine umfassende Theorie über 0/1-Polytope. Es scheint so als seien 0/1-Polytope besonders komplizierte Objekte. Die Ergebnisse, welche in dieser Dissertation dargestellt werden, gruppieren sich um drei Hauptthemen: (1) obere Schranken für die minimale Anzahl von Seiten (Kanten und Facetten), (2) eine Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani über die Kantenexpansion und (3) zufällige 0/1-Polytope. Zufälligen 0/1-Polytope können aus zwei verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachtet werden. Zum einen kann man Zufall benutzen, um die Komplexität allgemeiner 0/1-Polytope zu durchbrechen. Zum anderen kann man untersuchen, welche Eigenschaften zufällige 0/1-Polytope mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit besitzen. Dies sind dann typische Eigenschaften von 0/1-Polytopen und können nützlich sein, um Eigenschaften spezieller 0/1-Polytope einzuordnen. Nach einer kurzen Einführung in die Grundlagen der Polytoptheorie und einen Überblick über den aktuellen Stand der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der 0/1-Polytope, werden Grundlagen aus der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie kurz eingeführt. Die Ergebnisse zu zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen (3) umfassen: (a) Schwellenwert Resultate mit exponentieller Konvergenz zu der Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass \$k\$ zufällige Ecken eines zufälligen 0/1-Polytopes eine \$(k-1)\$-dimensionale Seite bilden; (b) Es gibt 0/1-Polytope mit exponentiell kleiner Eckenexpansion; (c) für jedes \$k\$ gibt es eine Konstante \$c\_k\$, so dass ein zufälliges 0/1-Polytop in \$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$ mit höchstens \$2{\textasciicircum}\{cd\}\$ Ecken sehr wahrscheinlich \$k\$-nachbarschaftlich ist. Ergebnis (b) zeigt, dass es für die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2) nicht genügt die Eckenexpansion zu untersuchen. Allerdings scheint es schwierig oder unmöglich zu sein, dieses Negativresultat auf die Kantenexpansion auszuweiten. Ergebnisse (a) und (c) zeigen typische Eigenschaften von zufälligen 0/1-Polytopen. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass ein vollständiger Graph für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung nichts besonderes sind, da diese Polytope meistens nur sub-exponentiell viele Ecken haben. Bekannte Beispiele für 0/1-Polytope aus der kombinatorischen Optimierung sind Traveling Salesman Polytope'' und Cut-Polytope''. Im letzten Kapitel stellen wir revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope vor. Diese speziellen Knap{\textbackslash}-sack-Poly{\textbackslash}-tope haben sehr wenige Facetten und Kanten. Wir benutzen diese Polytope, um zu zeigen, dass es in jeder Dimension \$d\$ und sinnvoller Eckenzahl \$n\$ ein \$d\$-dimensionales 0/1-Polytope mit \$n\$ Ecken gibt, welches höchstens \$3d\$ Facetten und Eckengrad höchstens \$d+8\$ hat. Dies sind die ersten Resultate zu oberen Schranken an die minimale Anzahl der Seiten von 0/1-Polytopen (1). Trotz des dünnen Graphen erfüllen diese 0/1-Polytope die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani (2). Abschließend betrachten wir noch kurz "erweiterte revlex-initiale 0/1-Polytope", welche eine weiterführende Richtung in der Untersuchung von Knapsack-Polytopen im Hinblick auf die Vermutung von Mihail und Vazirani sein können.},

	abstract = {We study extensions of compressive sensing and low rank matrix recovery to the recovery of tensors of low rank from incomplete linear information. While the reconstruction of low rank matrices via nuclear norm minimization is rather well-understand by now, almost no theory is available so far for the extension to higher order tensors due to various theoretical and computational difficulties arising for tensor decompositions. In fact, nuclear norm minimization for matrix recovery is a tractable convex relaxation approach, but the extension of the nuclear norm to tensors is in general NP-hard to compute. In this article, we introduce convex relaxations of the tensor nuclear norm which are computable in polynomial time via semidefinite programming. Our approach is based on theta bodies, a concept from real computational algebraic geometry which is similar to the one of the better known Lasserre relaxations. We introduce polynomial ideals which are generated by the second-order minors corresponding to different matricizations of the tensor (where the tensor entries are treated as variables) such that the nuclear norm ball is the convex hull of the algebraic variety of the ideal. The theta body of order k for such an ideal generates a new norm which we call the θk-norm. We show that in the matrix case, these norms reduce to the standard nuclear norm. For tensors of order three or higher however, we indeed obtain new norms. The sequence of the corresponding unit-θk-norm balls converges asymptotically to the unit tensor nuclear norm ball. By providing the Gröbner basis for the ideals, we explicitly give semidefinite programs for the computation of the θk-norm and for the minimization of the θk-norm under an affine constraint. Finally, numerical experiments for order-three tensor recovery via θ1-norm minimization suggest that our approach successfully reconstructs tensors of low rank from incomplete linear (random) measurements.},

	abstract = {This master's project concerns the use of multi-agent design principles in making efficient solvers for NP-complete problems. The design of computer programs
 as multi-agent systems presents a new and very promising software engineering
 paradigm, where systems are described as individual problem-solving agents pursuing high-level goals. Recently, researchers have started to apply the multi-agent
 paradigm to the construction of efficient solvers for NP-complete problems. This
 has resulted in very effective tools for routing problems, graph partitioning and
 SAT-solving.
 The objective of the present project is to make further studies into the application
 of multi-agent principles to solving NP-complete problems. More specifically, the
 project has the following two goals. First, it should result in a general discussion of
 the use of multi-agent approaches to solving NP-complete problems. This should
 include a discussion of strengths and weaknesses compared to other approaches of
 solving the same problems. Second, it should result in a concrete software tool for
 solving n2 £ n2 Sudoku puzzles, which is known to be an NP-complete problem.
 The tool should be benchmarked against other solvers for Sudoku.},

	abstract = {Current advances in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in general, and deep learning in particular have reached unprecedented impact not only across research communities, but also over popular media channels. However, concerns about interpretability and accountability of AI have been raised by influential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and explainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems. The insights provided by neural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for interpretable and accountable AI systems.},

The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source. By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources. KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques. It maps problem-specific “domain theories”, represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation. KBANN is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology. Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by KBANN generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.},

C-IL2P is a new massively parallel computational model based on a feedforward Artificial Neural Network that integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge, with deductive learning from Logic Programming. Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-IL2P to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically DNA sequence analyses. Comparisons with the results obtained by some of the main neural, symbolic, and hybrid inductive learning systems, using the same domain knowledge, show the effectiveness of C-IL2P.},

	abstract = {Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.},

We substantiate our theoretical considerations regarding the collective learning capabilities of our model by the means of experiments on both a new dataset and a dataset commonly used in entity resolution. Furthermore, we show on common benchmark datasets that our approach achieves better or on-par results, if compared to current state-of-the-art relational learning solutions, while it is significantly faster to compute.},

In addition, the new book is accompanied by online Python code, using libraries such as scikit-learn, JAX, PyTorch, and Tensorflow, which can be used to reproduce nearly all the figures; this code can be run inside a web browser using cloud-based notebooks, and provides a practical complement to the theoretical topics discussed in the book. This introductory text will be followed by a sequel that covers more advanced topics, taking the same probabilistic approach.},

In this paper, the prowess of tensor networks is demonstrated on the particular task of one-class anomaly detection. We exploit the memory and computational efficiency of tensor networks to learn a linear transformation over a space with dimension exponential in the number of original features. The linearity of our model enables us to ensure a tight fit around training instances by penalizing the model's global tendency to a predict normality via its Frobenius norm---a task that is infeasible for most deep learning models. Our method outperforms deep and classical algorithms on tabular datasets and produces competitive results on image datasets, despite not exploiting the locality of images.},

By connecting these fields, we highlight a series of opportunities that can benefit both communities. Our work generalizes popular tensor factorizations within the circuit language, and unifies various circuit learning algorithms under a single, generalized hierarchical factorization framework. Specifically, we introduce a modular "Lego block" approach to build tensorized circuit architectures. This, in turn, allows us to systematically construct and explore various circuit and tensor factorization models while maintaining tractability. This connection not only clarifies similarities and differences in existing models, but also enables the development of a comprehensive pipeline for building and optimizing new circuit/tensor factorization architectures. We show the effectiveness of our framework through extensive empirical evaluations, and highlight new research opportunities for tensor factorizations in probabilistic modeling.},
